## The Task
All Foods, is a grocery store in Melbourne, Australia that sells a variety of groceries ranging from fresh produce to grains to snacks to dairy and eggs and more. And to cater to the diverse population of Melbourne they have even introduced foods from asian countries such as Sri Lanka! 



In the year 2017, the store operated for all hours of the day. However for the year 2018, the store changed strategy and was open only from 7am to 7pm daily. This dropped their revenues by more than $50,000 and profits by more than $40,000!



While this strategy has allowed them to save on operations cost, they are keen for it not impact their revenue any further for the year 2019. Therefore they have hired you and your team as an analyst to gain insights and ideas that can help them recover the lost revenues due to change in time. 



Note: 

Many of groceries they sell in their store are self manufactured or grown on their farms which makes the buying price of many of their grocery items $0.00. This means all revenue earned on these items is a profit. The rest of the produce is bought from outside vendors which is why the buying price is above $0.00. 

### Research Questions:
* Which items should the store stop selling? Why?
* How does the year 2017 compare to the year 2018? Were there any significant changes in purchasing habits of the customers?
